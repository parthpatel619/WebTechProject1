					<a href="img/tab-img3_LG.jpg"><img src="img/tab-img3.jpg" class="pull-left"></a>This year was an amazing year for sneakers, if Instagram is any indication. British-based graphic designer Dan Freebairn, who posts his artistic renditions of popular sneakers on his Instagram account, @KickPosters, decided to see just how amazing it was. He dug into the numbers, and it turns out the most popular sneaker brand by sales, Nike, can't keep up with its European rival on Instagram.Adidas racked up 78.8 million likes on its account, @adidasoriginals, likely due to the insane popularity of its Yeezy Boost collaboration with Kanye West. Nike, even across its @nike, @nikesportswear, and @jumpman23 (Jordan) brands, couldn't keep up with the popularity of Yeezy. The sneaker's iterations, of which six have been released so far (the most recent on December 31), have all sold out instantly and subsequently sold for thousands on Ebay. In fact, West's collaboration with Adidas is even more popular than the collaboration with Nike he did back in 2009, according to NikeKicks.com.</p>

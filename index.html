		<h1>“ADIDAS IS ALL IN”!</h1>

		<p>When Adidas started up, though it was just a small firm, it had aimed at the world market. Therefore, during its early period, Adidas had regarded products technology innovation as its motivation to explore market and enhance brand awareness. « Function always the first » and « Giving athletes the best » is the principle of the corporate brand development. The brothers split up in 1947, with Rudi forming a new firm that he called Ruda– from Rudolf Dassler, later rebranded Puma, and Adi forming a company formally registered as Adidas AG from Adi Dassler on 18 August 1949. Adidas clothing and sports shoes are usually with three-parallel designs, which is also characteristic of adidas. « Adidas is all in » is the current global marketing strategy for Adidas. The slogan aims to tie all brands and labels together, presenting a unified image to consumers interested in sports, fashion, street, music and pop culture. « Impossible is Nothing » was the previous mainstream marketing slogan for Adidas.</p>
